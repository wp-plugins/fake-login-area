Allows you to display a user login form to nowhere.

== Description ==

Do you want your organization to appear bigger, or more important/legitimate/established than you are right now?
Maybe you just want to add a sense of mystery to your website. Whatever your reason, the presence of a user login area
on your website will help you achieve that effect for your site visitors.

After installing this plugin, simply add the class "flaform" to the desired link. When the user clicks the link, a
modal window will appear with a user/password prompt to log in. Of course, the form does nothing and will always claim
to "fail" the login, but it still makes it look like you have more to offer!

Huge props to [SweetAlert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/), the awesome popup window that I am using with this
plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Seriously? =
Believe it or not, this plugin came about after a legitimate client asked for one of these. After discussing with
others, I decided this was something that other people may want as well.

= Can I customize the form? =
Soon! Early versions of this plugin just want to put the functionality in your hands, but I plan to allow for all sorts
of customizations of the form including colors, all of the text, number of fields, field labels, and more.

== Screenshots ==

1. The login form itself
2. The "error" message displayed to the user
